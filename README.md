# weezer-box
Guide/Source code to make a weezer box of your own

-------------
## Construction
You'll need:
* Raspberry Pi (any model is fine)
* Pushbutton
* Small box
* Wires

Place the raspberry pi in the box so that the power plug and aux plug are facing the wall, and so that it's steady in the box and won't move. (Alternatively, you can tape/nail it down.) 
Cut holes in the box so these are accessible from outside the box. Cut a hole in the top of the box for the button and put it through.

Put a wire in GPIO pin 2 and in a ground pin (a pin guide can be found [here](https://pinout.xyz/)). Connect the other ends to the button. (Optionally, put a power bank into the box for maximum portability.)

It should look something like this!
